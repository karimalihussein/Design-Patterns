Concepts in Abstraction and Encapsulation
oop concepts




- Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation and un-necessary
details or data from the user. It's the process of hiding complexity and
focusing on on what functionalities are available to use.


- Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and code together as a
single unit.


- Inheritance is the concept in which one object acquires/inherits all the
properties and behaviors of a parent object.


- Polymorphism is the concept by which we can perform a single action in
different ways. Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and
morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So
polymorphism means many forms.

Encapsulation
Encabsulation solves it implementation
level.

Encapsulation means binding the code
